# CPP, Include, and Deploy

### Include

The Include folder has all of the header files (.hpp and .h) that are required for your .cpp files. In Include there is also Constants.hpp. This is the file where all of your constants are. When you need to make a constant, use "#define NAME_OF_VARABLE value". The value here is always a basic type (int, double, float, string, etc.).

### CPP

The CPP folder is where all of the CPP files are. This is the main code where you will be defining methods and setting non-const variables
